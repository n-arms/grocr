grocr - liquid measurement and prediction device firmware
=========================================================
grocr contains multiple software modules which contribute to the STM32 firmware
implementing a liquid measurement and prediction device (LMPD).  The LMPD
models liquid usage rates, indicates levels, warns when liquid is running low,
and predicts when liquid levels must be replenished.

The following software modules are implemented:
- i2c (I2C code)
- ham (Hamming Error Correction code)
- lc  (Load Cell driver)
- lcd (LCD driver)
- lsr (Linear Regression code)

The following firmware modules are implemented:
- display-mod (using i2c, ham, lcd, and lsr)
- measure-mod (using i2c, ham, and lc)

An explanation of each of the software modules follows:
